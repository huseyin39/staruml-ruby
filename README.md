# staruml-ruby

staruml-ruby is a Ruby extension for [StarUML][staruml] 2. This extension helps you
to generate Ruby code from a UML class diagram.

## Current Status

This extension currently supports generating Ruby code from a UML class diagram.

### Supported UML Concepts

This tool supports StarUML model below.

**Classes**

* tool will generate a separated `.rb` file that contains a Ruby class.
* the generated file name will be `snake_case.rb` (file name refers to the name of
  Ruby class).
* constructor is generated by default (`def initialize` method).
* a to string instance method is generated by default (`def to_s` method).
* code documentation will be generated at the top of class name.

**Attributes of clasess**
* methods for set and get attributes are generated by default (it doesn't use
  `attr_accessor :an_attribute`).
* methods for set and get attributes are grouped by theirs visibility. Same
  condition is applied for attribute accessor.
* code documentation will be generated at the top of attribute accessor
  declaration if it uses attribute accessor rather than set and get attributes.

**Methods of classes**

* tool will generate a grouped method based on its visibility (`public`,
  `protected`, and `private` methods).
* the generated method name is same as your method name in the model.
* code documentation will be generated at the top of method name.

**Method Parameters**

tool will generate method parameters.

**Generalization**

* tool will generate a separated `.rb` file that contains an inheritance class.
* the generated class name will be `class DerivedClass < BaseClass`.
* constructor and a to string instance method are generated by default.

**Packages**

* tool will convert to Ruby module (as a folder with name `packagename`
  folder).
* the `packagename` folder contains classes that belong to the package.
* code documentation will be generated at the top of package name.

**Constants**

* tool will generate constants.
* the constants support public and private constants.

## Installation

The simplest way to install staruml-ruby is from StarUML extension repository.
This installation method is explained as follows:

1. Open StarUML.
2. Click **Tools** -> **Extension Manager...**. The Extension Manager window
   will appear as a pop window.
3. Install the Ruby extension by clicking **Install** button.

Note that internet connection is needed to perfom the installation.

StarUML extension repository stores extensions that officially registered.
Because of it, I **highly recommend** to use this method. Registered
extensions are available on [this page][starumlextension].

See [Installation][installation] for other installation methods.

## How to use this extension

Please, follow these steps below.

1. Click the menu (**Tools** -> **Ruby** -> **Generate Code...**).
2. Select a model which will be generated its code in the pop window. And then,
   click **OK**.
3. Select a location where the generated code will be saved.
4. The generated code will be saved in the place where you selected before.

## How to configure this extension

You can configure the extension before generating the code.

1. Click the menu (**Tools** -> **Ruby** -> **Configure...**).
2. Manage the configuration for code generation (there are some options there). You
   can always restore default configurations.
3. Click **Close** when you have configured it.
